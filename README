## 📎 Theory
GMMs model a data distribution as a mixture of multiple Gaussian densities, which makes them extremely effective for audio because real-world audio features (MFCCs, spectral coefficients) are highly variable and multi-modal.

Different sounds (phonemes, instruments, timbres) produce clusters of feature vectors in different regions of the feature space.
A single Gaussian cannot capture this complexity, but a mixture of Gaussians can approximate any continuous density. This lets GMMs:

✅ 1. Capture Multi-Modal Structure

Audio frames from different sound sources or phonemes form different “clouds” in feature space.
GMMs naturally model these using multiple components, each specializing in one pattern.

✅ 2. Handle Frame-Level Variability

Audio features change every 10–20 ms.
GMMs assume each frame is generated from one latent Gaussian component → perfect for frame-based modeling like speech and music.

✅ 3. Smooth, Continuous Probability Estimation

Gaussian functions give smooth boundaries and soft assignments, which works better than hard clustering (K-means) for noisy, overlapping audio features.

✅ 4. Mathematical Convenience

GMMs integrate perfectly with algorithms used in audio:

EM algorithm → easy parameter learning

HMM + GMM → classical backbone of speech recognition

Efficient likelihood computation for classification
